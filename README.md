* As you can tell, this app is not that cool actually.

* And, play 2.1 doens't work with clouldfoundry or anything!!! (At this moment at least)

* I have to use play 2.0 in order to put it on clould foundry.

* In addition, altough play MVC is cool, Java is not. (Shhh)

* OAuth is cool, baisc auth is not.

* Twitter is cool, weibo is not.
